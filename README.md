## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Learned more about CSS Grid by defining a single-column grid layout for mobile devices and a more complex grid layout for larger screens using media queries.
- Used `grid-template-areas` to define named grid areas, making it easier to control the placement of grid items.

### Useful resources

- [An Interactive Guide to CSS Grid](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-grid/) - This guide helped me understand the basics of CSS Grid in a very easy way. It's very useful to anyone who doesnt have much experience working with grid layouts.
- [Learn CSS Grid the easy way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU&t=743s&ab_channel=KevinPowell) - This video by Kevin Powell helped me solve some trouble I had when adjusting the different sizes of each testimony card when the layout changed.
